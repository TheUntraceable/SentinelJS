                <p>The plans for version 1.1 are to make the website a lot cleaner and add new pages to the website. We also plan to remove a few bugs and add a new couple commands/features. I plan on adding this blogs feature for updates ect...</p>
                <h2 id="when-will-it-be-released">When will it be released?</h2>
                    <p>I plan on releasing this version 1.1 before the new <strong>Privileged Message Intents</strong> are released. This may require me to verify the bot in the even that the bot reaches 100+ guilds. This may need me to deprecate a few features.</p>
                <h2 id="what-is-taking-so-long">What's taking you so long?</h2>
                    <p>Well, I work mainly alone, I have to do most thing myself and only I know what I want and so, as you can probably see, not many people can help. I also am handling many other projects.</p>
